        <p>I'm Ben Payne, a full stack web developer currently working at
            <a href="https://northpointe.com">Northpointe Bank</a> in Grand Rapids, MI.
        </p>
        <p>
            I create dynamic web applications using PHP, MySql, Javascript, HTML and CSS. I enjoy
            working with Laravel, Slim, WordPress, October CMS, SASS, Node, and jQuery.
        </p>
        <p>
            I see every new challenge as an opportunity to learn. My favorite assignments are those that require me to
            push beyond my boundaries and acquire new skills and knowledge in order to complete them.
        </p>
